## Setup monitoring using Docker
If you want to set up monitoring using Docker, you can use the following commands:

In the folder

* Copy the [.env.example](./.env.example) file to `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
* Make sure your Prometheus config [file](./prometheus.yml) is updated with the metrics port (`NODE_METRICS_PORT`) of the EigenDA node.
* Make sure the EigenDA container name is also set correctly in the Prometheus config file. 
You can find that in EigenDA [.env](../.env.example) file (`MAIN_SERVICE_NAME`)
* Make sure the location of prometheus file is correct in [.env](./.env.example) file

Once correct config is set up, run the following command to start the monitoring stack
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Your setup should ensure Prometheus is run in the same Docker network as EigenDA. Run the following command for this purpose:
```bash
docker network connect eigenda-network prometheus
```
Note: `eigenda-network` is the name of the network in which EigenDA is running. You can check the network name in EigenDA [.env](../.env.example) file (`NETWORK_NAME`).

This will make sure `Prometheus` can scrape the metrics from `EigenDA` node.


#### Useful Dashboards
EigenDA offers a set of Grafana dashboards that are automatically imported when initializing the monitoring stack.
